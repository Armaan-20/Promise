🚀 MyPromise — Rebuilding JavaScript Promises From Scratch

A custom implementation of JavaScript’s native Promise built from the ground up to deeply understand:

The Event Loop

Microtasks vs Macrotasks

How .then() chaining really works

How error propagation travels through promise chains

This project is part of my journey to move from using JavaScript features to actually understanding how they work internally.
